  This port allows you to write greek documents in LaTeX, with both greektext
and latintext,  without having to switch between the two with the usual
commands \greektext, \latintext (or any other): you just write greek or latin
text.

  To use it, include the line:
\usepackage{auto-greek}
in the preample of your .tex (see included ag-test.tex).

  The port installs postscript fonts created by Angelos Haritsis (Arial, Times,
Courier) and uses hyphenation patterns for greek by:
Regina Mourtou  (the semantics) and Stefanos Maganaris (pattern generation).
The patterns were adapted to the Windows ASCII position by G. Moustakides.

WARNING: Sometimes using auto-greek seems to break other packages. In many
cases the solution is to simply put the usepackage command last.
eg.

Problematic:
\usepackage{auto-greek}
\usepackage{graphicx}

OK:
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{auto-greek}
